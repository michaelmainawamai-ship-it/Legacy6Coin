## 2. Vision

The crypto world is crowded with short-lived projects driven by speculation, hype, and manipulation. Legacy 6 Coin takes a different path.

**Vision:**  
To become a globally recognized digital asset that represents resilience, transparency, and meaningful participation.

Legacy 6 Coin is not positioned as a meme coin or a quick pump, but as a symbol coin: a token that carries a story and identity alongside its technical existence on-chain.

## 3. Mission

Legacy 6 Coin’s mission can be summarized in three pillars:

1. **Resilience:**  
   Represent the idea that value can emerge from adversity and that long-term strength matters more than short-term hype.

2. **Transparency:**  
   Maintain clear, open communication about the contract, supply, roadmap, and project direction.

3. **Global Participation:**  
   Create an asset that is accessible to anyone, anywhere, who resonates with the story and values of the project.
